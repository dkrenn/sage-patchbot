The Sage patchbot relies on volunteers to contribute CPU.

<p>If you'd like to see your patches get tested quicker, on architectures you care about,
consider contributing yourself by running

<pre style="padding-left: 2em">
sage -i http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/robertwb/patches/patchbot-2.1.spkg
sage -patchbot
</pre>

in an unused Sage install.
The patchbot supports various configurations, e.g. to give preference to components
you care about or to run only at night.
See the <a href="http://wiki.sagemath.org/buildbot">wiki</a> for more details.
